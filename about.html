        <h2>Why should I sign up?</h2>
        <p>The number of patients waiting for organs changes every day. As of January 2023, the number of patients on the national transplant waiting list was more than 104,000. Every ten minutes, another person is added to the list.</p>
        <p>The number of patients who need a lifesaving transplant goes up faster than the number of available organs.</p>

    <section id="make-difference">
        <h2>How can I make a difference by signing up?</h2>
        <p>Signing up to be an organ donor means you may someday be able to help others in need. Just one donor can provide lifesaving organs to up to eight people. One donor may also impact the lives of others with tissue donation.</p>
        <p>Not everyone who signs up as a donor is able to donate. In fact, only three in 1,000 people die in a way that allows for organ donation after death.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="minorities">
        <h2>Why should minorities sign up as organ donors?</h2>
        <p>More than half of all people on the transplant waiting list are from a minority group. Some diseases that cause end-stage organ failure are more common in these groups of people.</p>
        <p>An organ transplant is sometimes the best—or only—option for saving a life.</p>

    <section id="after-sign-up">
        <h2>What Happens After Sign Up</h2>
        <p><strong>Share Your Decision with Family</strong>: Signing up to be an organ donor is the first step in making your decision known. After you sign up, let the people closest to you know. You may save them from having to make the decision at a difficult time.</p>
        <p><strong>Encourage Others and Spread the Word</strong>: You may want to share your decision with your friends and your community. This may encourage them to sign up as a donor. You can also get involved with other groups by joining donation awareness efforts.</p>
        <p><strong>Update Your Donor Information</strong>: Your state donor registry allows you to sign up and to change your information. Many states allow you to choose which organs and tissues you want to donate. In other states, registered donors donate everything that can be used. Make sure your organ donor information is up to date if your address changes. You can change your donor information on your state's site.</p>

    <section id="what-is-donation">
        <h2>What Is Donation?</h2>
        <p>Donation is the giving of an organ and tissue to help someone that needs a transplant.</p>
        <p>A transplant can save or transform the life of a person. One organ donor can save up to 7 lives and help many more through eye and tissue donation. This relies on donors and their families agreeing to donate their organs and tissue after death.</p>

    <section id="why-is-donation-important">
        <h2>Why Is Donation Important?</h2>
        <p>At any one time, there are around 1,750 Australians on the organ transplant waiting list. Unfortunately, there are fewer donor organs available than there are people waiting. Some people die waiting for a transplant. Some spend weeks or months in hospital, while others make several trips to hospital every week for treatment.</p>
        <p>People who need an organ transplant are usually very sick or dying, because one or more of their organs is failing. They range from children through to older Australians.</p>
        <p>Many on the organ transplant waiting list have a congenital or genetic condition, illness, or sudden organ failure that will make them very sick and in need of a transplant.</p>
        <p>We never know when illness could affect a family member, friend, or colleague who may need a transplant.</p>
