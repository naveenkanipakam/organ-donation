            <li>Cross-matching helps confirm compatibility and reduce the risk of rejection.</li>
            <li>Donors are typically instructed to follow specific preoperative instructions, which may include fasting before surgery and discontinuing certain medications or supplements in the days leading up to the procedure.</li>
            <li>Donors are advised to maintain good health by staying hydrated, getting adequate rest, and following a balanced diet in the days before surgery.</li>
            <li>Donors may receive counseling and emotional support to help them cope with the stress and anxiety associated with organ donation.</li>
            <li>Donors should be aware of legal and ethical considerations related to organ donation, including ensuring they are making the decision voluntarily and without coercion.</li>
            <li>It's important for donors to have a support system in place, including family and friends who can provide emotional support before and after the procedure.</li>
